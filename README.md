# Procedural-Generated-Cylinder
I created a procedural generated cylinder allowing to freely modify the data of the mesh of the cylinder.
This is still not yet finished and I'm adding a modification to the cylinder.

This script is used as a way to create the platform on a game called "Helix Jump" and that I wanted to freely modify the platform mesh data. I created this because 
I was too lazy to create modified versions of the platforms and wanted to procedural generate it to give more randomness and control with the mesh data.
