# Procedural-Generated-Cylinder
I created a procedurally generated cylinder, that allows you to freely modify the data in the mesh of the cylinder. This is still not finished, and I'm still adding features and modifications to the code.

This script is used as a way to create a platform similar to the game "Helix Jump," and I wanted to freely modify the platform procedurally. I created this because I was too lazy to model for each platform version and wanted to procedurally generate it to give more randomness and control.

**How to use:**

You can use "CylinderMeshUpdate.cs" or "ProceduralMeshCylinder.cs" just use one of this script for each GameObject.

**CylinderMeshUpdate.cs:** This script is a derived class of the "ProceduralMeshCylinder.cs" and gives you more access to modifying your cylinder.

**ProceduralMeshCylinder.cs:** This is the profile of the cylinder that will modify how your cylinder will look like.
