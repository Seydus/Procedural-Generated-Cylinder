# Procedural-Generated-Cylinder
I created a procedural generated cylinder allowing to freely modify the data of the mesh of the cylinder.
This is still not yet finished and I'm still adding features and modification to the code.

This script is used as a way to create a platform similar to the game called "Helix Jump" and that I wanted to freely modify the platform procedurally. I created this because 
I was too lazy to model for each platform versions and wanted to procedural generate it to give more randomness and control.

**How to use:**

You can use "CylinderMeshUpdate.cs" or "ProceduralMeshCylinder.cs" just use one of this scripts for your needs.
CylinderMeshUpdate.cs: This script is a derived class of the "ProceduralMeshCylinder.cs" and gives you more access to modifying the cylinder
ProceduralMeshCylinder.cs: This is the profile of the cylinder modifying how your cylinder will look like.
